#### Steps to start working on this project

- fork the repo
- clone the forked repo on your github
- run `git checkout -b <branch name>` to create your own branch, replace the `<branch name>` with your branch name choice or run `git checkout <branch name>` or `git switch <branch name>` to switch to your branch if you all created the branch
- run `git branch` to confirm the branch you are on
- `cd` into the cloned repo and run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies on your machine
- run `pnpm run dev` to create a port with vite and load the page on your browser ‚ö°Ô∏è
- each member can create a component for their tasks and also check to see what component already exists so they can import in their component rather than starting a new one
- remember to update this Readme with what you worked on
- after you are done, stage all changes in your branch and push to github.
- if there were conflicts when trying to push due to updates on the remote branch from other contributors, run `git pull --rebase origin main` to update your local codebase and then push your changes.
- make a pull request for your changes to be merged
